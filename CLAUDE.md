- keep functions small, controllers skinny, try to maintain separation of templates and calculation code
- add tests whenever possible
- tests can be run from the root with `npm run test` and should be run before considering a feature finished
- when developing a new feature, write a test first and then get it to pass
- also run `npm run check` from the root before considering a task finished
- to make database requests use `npm run db:query`
- database schema is located at backend/prisma/schema.prisma
- `npm run migrate` from the root handles database migrations
- use types in the shared directory whenever possible to maintain type safety between the inputs and outputs of the front and back end
- keep documentation up to date when making changes to architecture, adding new services, or modifying infrastructure. Current state documentation lives in docs/ directory (see docs/README.md for structure). Planning documentation should be placed in docs/plans/
